# Event Listener Exercises

    1. Make a page that has on it an element that is 100px by 100px in size, has absolute positioning, and has a solid background color. Add an event handler that makes this box center itself directly under the user's mouse pointer as it is moved across the screen.

    2. Make a page that has a <textarea> element on it. As the user types visible characters into this field, the characters should be replaced with the characters in the corresponding position in the Gettysburg Address. (Note - you can get and set the text in a <textarea> through its value property.)

    3. Make a page that has on it an element that is 100px by 100px in size and has a solid black border. When the user mouses down on this box, its background should change to a randomly selected color. When the user mouses up on it, its background should change to another randomly selected color.

    4. Make a page that has on it an element that is 200px by 200px in size and has a solid background color. Nest within that element another element that is 50px by 50px in size and has a different solid background color. When the user clicks on the outer element its background color should change to a randomly selected color. However, if the user clicks on the inner element, the inner element's background color should change to a randomly selected background color but the outer element's background color should not change at all.
